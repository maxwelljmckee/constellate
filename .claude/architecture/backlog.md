# Audri — Backlog

Things we plan to do but deferred out of MVP. Centralized here so we don't lose track as we pile "do this later" notes into `todos.md` and `tradeoffs.md`.

Each entry is sortable by **Priority**, **Effort**, and **Type**. Not a commitment of order or timing — just a structured snapshot of the post-MVP horizon.

---

## Legend

**Priority** (urgency once MVP ships)
- **P0** — V1 first wave; highest priority post-MVP
- **P1** — V1, likely inclusion
- **P2** — V1+ beyond; triggered by observed need
- **P3** — Nice-to-have; maybe never

**Effort** (rough size)
- **S** — < 1 day
- **M** — 1–3 days
- **L** — ~1 week
- **XL** — multi-week

**Type** — Feature / Infra / Data model / UX / Observability / Security / Cost-Business / KG maintenance / Tech debt (often combined when an item spans categories)

---

## Currently outstanding (slice-9 close-out — 2026-04-28)

Open carry-overs at end of MVP code-complete:

- **Manual: slice 6.5 resilience flow validation** — kill-app-mid-call + AppState-background recovery paths. Code shipped, unverified on device. Needs Max + a phone.
- **Manual: Sentry smoke test** — DSNs added for all three projects (`audri-server`, `audri-worker`, `audri-mobile`); verify capture by hitting `/health/sentry-test` with `X-Sentry-Test: $SUPABASE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` once redeploys are in.
- **EAS Build + TestFlight** — blocked on Apple Developer enrollment.
- **Mobile Sentry source-map upload** — gated on EAS, see "Environments" subsection.
- **PostHog feature flags** — needs PostHog project key to wire; see "Observability expansion" subsection.
- **Render staging environment** — see "Environments" subsection.

These are all dashboards / external-account / on-device tasks. None require additional code work to begin (PostHog will need code once the key arrives).

## Features

### Interaction modes

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Text mode (chat) | P0 | M | Feature | Text-based parallel to Call mode; same agent scaffolding, different I/O plumbing. Transcripts same shape as voice. Voice-first users can't always talk (meetings, noisy environments). Source: §9. |
| Ask mode | P2 | M | Feature | Short-question/short-answer path, lighter than full Call. Entry from anywhere in the app. Source: §9. |
| Note mode | P2 | M | Feature | Voice-to-transcript-to-KG bypassing dialogue. Shares ingestion pipeline. Source: §9. |
| Onboarding modes (long vs short + expectation-setting phase) | P0 | L | Feature + UX | Today's onboarding has one track. Split based on the user's current context — limited time/patience vs. more time/patience. Short mode focuses on discovering immediate needs to deliver fast value, then queues an "incomplete" state so subsequent calls can backfill the rest. Long mode is today's life-history-first interview. Adds a 3rd phase to the onboarding flow: **Self-Introduction → Expectation-Setting → User Interview**. Expectation-Setting evaluates which mode fits + banks trust by giving the user agency. Tied to a fourth core UX principle: **Control / Confidence / Autonomy** (alongside Proactiveness + Transparency). Long-term: an "Onboarding Checklist" surface that nudges users to keep setting up (plugins installed, connectors connected) until a threshold is met. Source: post-slice-6 retrospective. |
| **Interactive Call Surface (ICS)** — agent-driven UI in-call | **P0 (foundational)** | **XL** | **Feature + Infra (architectural direction)** | **Not a single feature; a foundational substrate that future capabilities will live inside.** Today's call screen is a passive audio-visualizer. ICS is the pattern where Gemini Live tool-calls each have BOTH a server-side handler AND a registered client-side renderer that mounts in a live in-call pane (drawer, in-app browser, canvas). The orb stays on top; everything else (connector OAuth, fetched preview, on-the-fly chart, mid-call artifact draft) renders in a region the agent can drive. Persistence flow: an in-call artifact buffer the user can voice-confirm into wiki/research/etc. ("save these graphs to project X"). **Seed use cases:** (1) **Connector OAuth mid-call** — onboarding asks "want to connect Gmail? Let me pull that up" → agent opens the Gmail OAuth pane in a drawer → user taps once → returns to flow. Removes the post-call friction of "go to plugins, find it, install, come back." (2) **On-the-fly data viz** — discussing stocks / trends / data → agent renders a chart in-pane → user can voice-save it to a wiki page. **Strong overlap with Skills** (P0 in Plugin capabilities below) — Skills is the *invocation* layer ("what" the agent offers); ICS is the *render* layer ("where" it surfaces). Should be scoped together when the time comes. **Build-the-platform-first risk:** tempting to design generically before specific use cases demand it; that path produces architecture you spend months refactoring. Discipline: through slices 6.5–9, every time we hit a moment of "ugh, I wish this could happen in-call instead of after," collect it in this entry's notes. By the time we have 3-4 such moments, the right shape becomes obvious from the use cases themselves. **First use case already identified:** connector OAuth during onboarding.

### Plugin capabilities (beyond MVP `research`)

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Trial artifacts during onboarding (mid-call kickoff exception) | P0 | M | Feature + Infra | Originally scoped for MVP but bumped to V1 to keep MVP lean. During onboarding only, agent proactively offers + queues low-cost trial artifacts based on stated interests so they're waiting on the user's home screen post-call. Requires: onboarding-only mid-call tool (`queue_trial_artifact(kind, payload)`); server validates `call_type='onboarding'`; `agent_tasks.is_trial: bool` column for tier-cap exemption; onboarding scaffolding's tool palette declares the tool, generic does NOT. Hard cap 3 trial artifacts per onboarding call. Source: §8 Chunk 4 (originally), §10. |
| **Skills** — context-aware capability suggestions | **P0** | M | Feature + Infra | Pre-defined contextual prompt patterns the agent advertises based on the user's current context (reviewing an artifact, discussing a page, looking at a transcript, etc.). Each Skill is a registered template that composes existing primitives (wiki write via fan-out, plugin invocation, inline generation) — no new artifact infrastructure required for lightweight Skills; heavier ones graduate to plugins. Solves the "users don't know what to ask for" prompting-skill barrier; greatly increases perceived value per session. Sits in a parallel `skillRegistry` alongside `pluginRegistry`. Composes into call-agent prompt Layer 4 (capability advertisement) with trigger-relevance as a 5th availability filter alongside the existing four (System / Tier-granted / User-enabled / Connector-ready). Naming follows Anthropic's existing mental model. Seed set candidates: cheatsheet-from-research (wiki write), brainstorm-next-questions (inline), tangent-research (invokes research plugin), recap-to-email (V1+ Gmail), promote-to-todo (todo write). **Strongly complementary with Interactive Call Surface (Interaction modes section)** — Skills is the invocation layer ("what" the agent offers); ICS is the render layer ("where" it surfaces). Scope them together. Source: §8 Chunk 2 (capability advertisement) extension. |
| Agent advertises uninstalled capabilities + self-installs via todo | P1 | M | Feature + Infra | Agent has awareness of the broader system capability set, including plugins the user hasn't installed. When a user expresses an intent that maps to an uninstalled plugin, agent advertises ("I could do that for you if you install the [X] plugin — want me to set that up?") and on confirmation, submits installation as a todo. Removes the friction of "go to plugin directory + install + come back." Capability-availability levels (§11) extend: agent's prompt includes a "could-be-installed" tier alongside the four current levels. Source: §8 Chunk 3 refinement, §15c. |
| Podcast plugin | P1 | L | Feature | Script + audio-file-ref + player UI module. First binary-artifact plugin. Forces Supabase Storage pipeline. Source: §3, §11, §15c. |
| Email-drafting plugin | P1 | L | Feature | Requires Gmail connector. User-confirm-required write policy. Source: §11, §15, §15c. |
| Calendar-event plugin | P1 | M | Feature | Requires Google Calendar connector. User-confirm-required at MVP scope. Source: §11, §15, §15c. |
| Daily/weekly brief plugin | P1 | M | Feature | Aggregates recent activity + wiki state. Source: §11, §15c. |
| Periodic usage + interest review | P2 | M | Feature | Scheduled background pass surfacing "you've been talking about X lately — want a weekly brief on it?" style recommendations. Own prompt + kind. Source: §13. |
| **Artifact → first-class entity routing** (link / convert / reingest) | **P0** | **L** | **Feature + Infra** | From an artifact detail view, the user can route the artifact to other first-class entities. Concrete operations from a research output: (a) **reingest as a Source** — flip `reingestsIntoWiki=true` for this artifact; ingestion fan-out treats it as a new transcript-like input + writes wiki sections cited back to it. (b) **Attach to a wiki page** — explicit junction (e.g. `wiki_page_research_attachments` or polymorphic `wiki_page_attachments`) so the page's detail view shows the research as a reference. (c) **Convert to another artifact kind** — research → podcast script (kicks off podcast plugin with the research as input); research → email draft (kicks off email plugin pre-filled). **Direction of relation matters:** todos→research is the existing direction (a todo can spawn a research task); research→todo doesn't make sense as a forward link. Generally: artifacts are downstream-of todos, upstream-of follow-on artifacts. Worth designing the polymorphic attachment table once + applying to all artifact kinds rather than per-kind tables. Source: post-slice-7 review. |
| **Open-source plugin ecosystem** | **P3 (V2+ — long horizon, needs design)** | **XL** | **Feature + Infra (architectural direction)** | Maintain a tightly-managed set of "core plugins" (research, podcast, email, etc.) AND open the plugin library to developer contributions, à la Obsidian / VS Code / Raycast. **Pros:** crowdsourcing effect (free feature growth), social/network effect (community + retention + organic discovery), reduces solo-dev maintenance burden on long-tail capabilities, strong differentiator vs walled-garden assistants. **Cons:** (a) **trust boundary** — every third-party plugin is potentially adversarial code reading user wiki + transcripts; needs a sandbox runtime, capability scopes (request-scope read, request-scope write, agent-scope read?, etc.), audit trail, kill-switch per plugin. (b) **Developer UX** — third-party devs need a way to test their plugins against a fake user wiki / transcripts without accessing the core app codebase. Implies a published SDK + plugin-author CLI + local dev runner. (c) **Code review / store moderation** — manual approval for the marketplace; supply-chain risk; license + IP terms. (d) **Versioning + compat** — plugin API has to be stable enough to support installed plugins across app updates. **Architectural prerequisites:** stable plugin contract (signature for `(ctx) => Promise<{output, sources}>` already locked in `specs/research-task-prompt.md` — that's a start), capability scopes on `agent_tasks`, plugin manifest format (yaml/json with declared scopes + connectors + UI surfaces), runtime sandbox (likely WASM or strict V8 isolate). Worth ~2 weeks of focused design before any code. Cross-references: `Add-plugin tile / plugin marketplace surface` under Mobile-app polish (UX surface for installing) + `Custom `search_google` tool + provider abstraction` (provider-abstraction is a similar pattern that could template plugin abstraction). Source: post-slice-9 V2+ planning. |

### Custom agents

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Custom agent creation UX | P1 | L | Feature | Beyond default Assistant. Name, voice, persona_prompt, user_prompt_notes editing. Voice picker. Source: §15b. |
| Assistant persona customization | P0 | S | Feature | User can rename / adjust voice / append `user_prompt_notes` on the default Assistant. Could sneak in before custom agents proper. |
| Agent deletion semantics | P2 | M | Infra | Tombstone + cascade the agent-scope subtree or block deletion with substantial content. Source: §15b. |
| Mid-session agent switching | P3 | S | Feature | "Actually, talk to the Health Coach about this." Probably forced call-end + new call. Source: §15b. |
| Per-agent onboarding interview | P2 | M | Feature | New custom agents run a truncated interview to seed their private wiki. Source: `specs/agents-and-scope.md`. |

### Knowledge ingestion expansion

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Upload sources pipeline | P1 | XL | Feature | URLs, files (PDF/markdown/text), images (OCR + vision), audio. Mirrors transcript flow. Requires Supabase Storage + per-type extraction. Source: features.md, §3, §6. |
| Feeds as sources (content partnerships) | P2 | XL | Feature | RSS/equivalent ingestion on schedule. Partner revenue-share accounting. Source: §5. |
| Email ingest (received email as context) | P2 | L | Feature | Inbox as a source stream. Requires Gmail connector read scope. Source: §6, §15. |
| **Subtree-scoped ingestion** | **P1** | **M** | **Feature + Infra** | Today ingestion's Flash candidate retrieval scans the entire wiki index for the user. For uploads / pasted documents that the user explicitly attaches to a particular project (or any subtree), restrict candidate retrieval + Pro fan-out's writeable surface to that subtree's pages. Avoids: (a) noise (a research paper attached to "Consensus" shouldn't update the user's `profile/health` page just because it touched on biology), (b) cross-project contamination, (c) unnecessary token spend on irrelevant candidates. Implementation sketch: ingestion job payload gains optional `scope_root_page_id`; `fetchUserWikiIndex` filters to descendants of that root; Pro prompt instructed that creates/updates outside the scope are skipped. Pairs with the upload-sources pipeline (above) and the explicit-attach UX. Source: post-slice-8 review. |
| **Noteworthiness criterion: ephemerality** | **P1** | **S** | **Feature (prompt)** | Pro fan-out's noteworthiness filter currently catches volume noise (single-mention claims, pure speculation) but doesn't gate on **how long the claim matters**. Add an explicit ephemerality dimension to the §2 noteworthiness section: claims should be evaluated on "does this matter in a few hours? tomorrow? next week?" Examples to bake into the prompt: ✅ "I dream of visiting Thailand someday" (durable interest, weeks/months/years horizon) → write to `profile/interests`. ❌ "I'm hungry for a hamburger right now" (ephemeral state, hours horizon) → skip with reason="ephemeral state". Edge cases: a strong feeling tied to an upcoming event ("I'm dreading Monday's review") may straddle — let the prompt note that ephemeral *current state* is skip-worthy but ephemeral *anchored to a durable concern* deserves capture against the relevant durable page (in this case `profile/work`). Source: post-slice-9 review. |

### Notifications + engagement

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Push notifications | P1 | M | Infra | Expo Push or native APNs/FCM. Per-platform cert management. MVP ships with in-app only. Source: §13. |
| Notifications feed data model | P1 | S | Data model | `notifications(id, user_id, kind, artifact_ref, body, read_at, snoozed_until, …)`. Source: §3, §13. |
| Notification grouping / snooze / dismiss | P1 | M | UX | Design pass on notification feed UI behavior. Source: §13. |
| Deferred confirmation (dropped-call flow) | P1 | M | Feature | Unconfirmed action items from a dropped call surface in notifications for deferred confirmation. Source: §8, §13. |
| Adaptive delivery channels | P2 | L | Feature | Global / per-task-type / per-schedule preferences: in-app, audio clip, email, push-summary. Source: features.md. |

### Scheduled + recurring content

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scheduled / recurring tasks | P1 | L | Feature + Infra | Configuration (conversational vs. settings), schedule storage, timezone handling. Cron / next-run engine (Graphile recurring jobs likely). Source: §12. |
| Pause/resume/edit schedules | P1 | M | UX | Source: §12. |
| Event-driven content | P3 | XL | Feature | RSS polling, topic-change detection, release alerts. Out of V1 entirely. Source: §12. |

### User-assigned todo capabilities

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Scheduled-reminder firing | P1 | M | Feature | `due_at` on user-assigned todos fires in-app (and V1+ push) notification. Depends on notification infra. Source: §4. |
| Project-scoped todo lists | P2 | S | UX | Already in data model (child `todos` pages under `project` pages). Needs UI surface in the Todos module. Source: §4. |

### Call mode expansion

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Contextual-call initialization from a wiki page / artifact | P1 | M | Feature | Start a call primed on the page the user is viewing. The viewed entity gets **priority preload** — same general-call preload as today, plus the focused entity injected with extra emphasis ("the user just opened this — they're likely calling about it"). Concrete trigger surfaces: wiki page detail, research output detail, todo detail, project detail. **Possible obsoletion:** if Interactive Call Surface lands first, this becomes redundant — the live agent would have UX-context-awareness via tools rather than a preload special-case. Track both paths; whichever lands first wins. Source: §8 + post-slice-7 review. |
| Call-type variants (task-specific calls) | P2 | L | Feature | Generic / contextual / "daily brief" / "brainstorm on X" call types with their own preload + prompt + call-end flow. Source: §8. |
| Mid-call tool set beyond `search_graph` | P2 | M | Feature | Web search, URL fetch, calendar peek. Source: §8. |
| Call resumption after network drop | P2 | L | Feature | Resume or start fresh on reconnect. Source: §8. |
| Audio retention policy | P2 | M | Data model + Infra | MVP keeps transcript-only. Reconsider raw audio retention if (a) transcript quality issues warrant source-review, (b) users want to replay calls, (c) compliance/audit requires it. Adds Supabase Storage bucket per user, retention policy, playback UI. Source: §8 Chunk 5. |
| Reconsider "Audri's speech is not a claim source" invariant | P2 | S | Tech debt | MVP excludes agent turns from commitment extraction (per `specs/fan-out-prompt.md` §4.1) to prevent closed-loop hallucination. Reconsider when: Audri's clarifying restatements ("so you mean X?") followed by user confirmation are losing useful claim signal, OR a confirmation-aware extraction policy ("treat agent turn as claim source if explicitly user-confirmed in next turn") becomes worth the complexity. Source: §8 Chunk 5. |
| **Proactive call-end (anti-addiction guardrail)** | **P1** | **M** | **Feature + Guardrail** | Audri proactively wraps the call after a configurable interval (default ~20 min? — to be tuned) with a graceful exit: "I've got plenty to work on — let's pick this up later." Prevents addictive engagement loops where the agent stays available indefinitely. Implementation: scaffolding gets a soft cap that nudges toward wrap-up at threshold, and a hard cap that triggers a definitive close-out turn. Per-user override possible (V1+ for users who genuinely need long sessions, e.g. extended onboarding). Falls under the broader **Guardrails** entry in Security + Compliance — this is the first concrete guardrail feature; track related ones (e.g. content guardrails, action guardrails) under that umbrella. Source: post-slice-8 UX principle: "friction proportional to addiction risk." |
| **Live-agent abort tool (mid-action cancellation)** | **P1** | **M** | **Feature + Infra** | Tool the agent can invoke mid-call to cleanly cancel an in-progress operation when the user pivots ("actually, never mind, let's talk about X instead"). Today the agent has no way to roll back: if it kicked off a research task or opened a UI surface and the user changes subject, the spawned action proceeds to completion. The abort tool gives the agent an explicit "drop what we were doing" affordance: cancel the agent_task (status='cancelled'), close any open in-call UI (Interactive Call Surface — see Interaction modes), un-stage any draft writes, free the conversational thread. Pairs tightly with **Interactive Call Surface (ICS)** since most cancel-able operations will live there. Without it, the user has to wait for completion + then dismiss results — bad UX. Source: post-slice-9 review. |
| **Generic-call scaffolding clause: Expectation Setting / Control / Autonomy** | **P1** | **S** | **Feature (prompt)** | Add an explicit instruction to the generic call scaffolding (and onboarding scaffolding too where applicable) directing the agent to *not assume* the kind of session the user wants. When uncertain whether the user is here for a quick note-taking exchange vs a long-form collaborative conversation, the agent should ask / clarify / offer options rather than barrel ahead. Concrete prompt cue: *"You don't always know what kind of experience the user wants. When the call's intent is ambiguous (a vague open, an unclear ask, or a context shift), pause briefly to clarify — 'are you looking to capture a quick note, or talk this through?' — instead of defaulting to either pole."* This is the fourth UX principle (**Control / Confidence / Autonomy**, alongside Proactiveness + Transparency, established post-slice-6) showing up at the prompt level. Source: post-slice-9 review. |
| **Live Agent ↔ UI capability parity** | **P0 (architectural goal)** | **XL** | **Feature + Infra (architectural direction)** | **Goal:** anything the user can do via the UI, the live agent can do via tools. Concrete operations to expose as live tools: link a research artifact to a wiki page, move a todo between buckets, mark a todo done, edit a wiki section, spawn research, attach an artifact to a project, tweak agent-config attributes (paired with "In-call agent-config adjustment" above), trigger account actions, navigate between plugin overlays via ICS. **Why this is foundational:** without parity, the voice surface is permanently second-class to the UI — users learn to "do it later in the UI" rather than trust the agent. Parity makes the voice/UI distinction disappear from the user's mental model. **Pattern:** every UI affordance ships in pairs — the human handler (button / tap / form) AND the agent tool (function-call schema + handler). Same backend code path, two entry points. Pairs tightly with **Interactive Call Surface** (rendering layer) + **Skills** (invocation discovery layer). Discipline rule going forward: every new UI capability we ship MUST come with the matching agent-tool registration; otherwise we accrue parity debt. Build-the-platform-first risk applies here too — don't expose tools speculatively, expose them as the matching UI surface lands. Source: post-slice-9 review. |
| **Incognito calls (no ingestion)** | **P1** | **S** | **Feature + UX** | New `call_type='incognito'` (or boolean `incognito` flag on `call_transcripts`) that opts the call out of post-call ingestion entirely — neither user-scope fan-out nor agent-scope ingestion runs. Transcript itself can either persist for the user's own retrieval (default) or auto-tombstone after a window (V2+ option). UX: a toggle on the call screen ("incognito mode") with a clear visual treatment (e.g. dimmed orb, subtle indicator chip) so the user always knows they're in this mode. Use cases: venting, sensitive emotional content, exploratory thinking the user doesn't want pinned to their wiki, hypothetical scenarios. Implementation: skip the ingestion + agent-scope job enqueues at `/calls/:id/end` when the flag is set; UI toggles the flag in `/calls/start` body. **Open question:** should the agent itself behave differently in incognito (no preload? different scaffolding clause acknowledging the user wants ephemeral conversation?) — likely yes; distinct preload posture (skip recent activity, skip wiki preload) and a distinct prompt clause ("the user has chosen ephemeral mode; don't reference their wiki, don't extract claims, treat this as a closed exchange"). Pairs with the broader **Guardrails** umbrella (user-facing privacy controls). Source: post-slice-9 review. |

## Infrastructure

### Plugin + registry

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime-installable plugins | P3 | XL | Infra | Plugin registry becomes DB-backed; installable at runtime vs. via code deploy. Deferred until bundle size or install flexibility becomes a real constraint. Source: §11, §15c, tradeoffs. |
| Third-party plugins / marketplace | P3 | XL | Infra | User-authored or marketplace plugins. Source: §15c. |
| UI module registry | P3 | M | Infra | Separate `uiModuleRegistry` for projection-based UI surfaces. Currently YAGNI'd (Wiki + Todos handled as client-side built-ins). Revisit when 3rd projection module emerges. Source: tradeoffs. |

### Queue / background-loop refinements

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Per-user fairness on `agent_tasks` | P2 | M | Infra | If one user's queue pressure starves others, add per-user `queue_name` pattern. Source: §11. |
| Per-kind concurrency caps | P2 | S | Infra | `queue_name='agent_tasks-${kind}'` if a specific kind needs throttling. Source: §11. |
| Handler checkpointing for long tasks | P2 | L | Infra | If LLM retry cost on crashes becomes material, add phased progress + partial-result caching. Source: §11, tradeoffs. |
| Reprocessing flows (transcript re-ingestion) | P2 | L | Infra | Prompt updates warrant re-running old transcripts. Requires dedup strategy (`(user_id, kind, stable_payload_fingerprint)` hash or `pipeline_version` tag). Source: §11. |
| Aggregate failure-rate alerts | P2 | M | Observability | Beyond Sentry per-error alerts, "failure rate > 5% in 5 min" style. Source: §11. |
| **Transactional email service** | **P0 (V1 prereq for waitlist)** | **S** | **Infra** | Outbound system email — distinct from the Gmail *connector* under "Connectors" (which is the user's own outbound). Use cases: waitlist invitation emails, password reset, account deletion confirmation, weekly-digest opt-ins (V1+). Provider: Resend or Postmark (both have ~$0–20/mo at our scale). Set up sending domain (DKIM/SPF/DMARC) for `talktoaudri.com` or whatever the prod domain ends up. Single helper `sendEmail({ to, subject, react|html })` that the admin interface + auth flows call. Source: post-slice-9 review (paired with waitlist + admin entries). |

### Connectors (all V1+)

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `connectors` table + OAuth flow | P1 | L | Infra | Per-user per-service rows, encrypted tokens, refresh flow, scopes, status. Token refresh as scheduled background task. Source: §15. |
| Capability registry (connector capabilities) | P1 | S | Infra | Module mapping `connector_kind → capabilities`. Plugins declare `requiredConnectors`. Source: §15. |
| Gmail integration | P1 | L | Feature + Infra | Google-first. Read vs. write scope decisions. Source: §15. |
| Calendar integration | P1 | L | Feature + Infra | Google-first. Source: §15. |
| Contacts integration | P1 | L | Feature + Infra | Google-first. Imported contacts map onto `person` pages + aliases. Source: §15. |
| Connector UX | P1 | M | UX | Settings screen; per-connector detail; disconnect action; granted-scopes display; connector-write receipts in activity stream. Source: §15. |

### Search expansion

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `search_graph` implementation (FTS first) | P0 | M | Infra | Postgres full-text search over `wiki_sections.content` + metadata. Source: §18. |
| Embedding pipeline (pgvector) | P2 | XL | Infra | Semantic search. Model choice, compute-on-edit freshness, blended ranking with FTS. Source: §18. |
| Custom `search_google` tool + provider abstraction | P1 | M | Infra | MVP uses Gemini Live's built-in Google search grounding (config flag, no custom tool). Migrate to a custom `search_google` tool with a provider abstraction layer (Tavily likely candidate, alternatives: Brave, SerpAPI, Perplexity) when triggered by per-call cost visibility needs, provider switching needs, or fine-grained budget control. Behavior: server-side tool, snippet-only return, conservative per-turn budget. Source: §8 Chunk 4. |
| `fetch_url` tool (read full URL content) | P2 | M | Feature + Infra | Beyond Google snippets — actually fetch + clean + extract URL contents for deeper grounding. Adds HTML extraction (Readability or similar), paywall handling, image/video skipping. Lets Audri summarize articles directly. Source: §8 Chunk 4. |

### Recent-activity cache

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Recent-activity materialized view or cache table | P2 | M | Infra + Data model | MVP computes recent activity (last N calls + wiki updates + completed artifacts + todos) via fresh query against `wiki_log` + `call_transcripts` + `agent_tasks` on each call start. When call-start latency becomes noticeable or the activity-stream UI (V1+) shares the same data, promote to a materialized view or dedicated cache table refreshed on event writes. Source: §8 Chunk 1. |
| **Recent artifacts in generic-call preload** | **P0** | **S** | **Feature + Infra** | Extend `loadGenericCallContext` to fetch the user's most recent N artifacts (research today; podcasts/email-drafts/calendar-events/briefs as those plugins land). Inject a thin "Recent artifacts" section into the preload block — title + kind + 1-line summary + timestamp + id. NOT full body — just enough that the agent has awareness ("I see we wrapped up that research on Italian restaurants yesterday"). Pairs with the artifact retrieval tool below for lazy full-body fetch when the agent decides it needs the depth. Source: post-slice-7 review. |
| **Live-agent artifact retrieval tools** | **P0** | **M** | **Feature + Infra** | Gemini Live function-call tools so the agent can pull full artifact bodies on demand: `fetch_research(id)`, `fetch_podcast(id)` (V1+), `fetch_email_draft(id)` (V1+), `fetch_brief(id)` (V1+), `fetch_calendar_event(id)` (V1+). Pairs with `fetch_page` (already in the research handler's tool palette per `specs/research-task-prompt.md`) — same pattern, different artifact kinds. Pattern generalizes: each artifact kind ships with both a preload-summary contributor AND a fetch-by-id tool. Tool registration lives in the call-agent prompt's tool palette; access gated by the same plugin-availability levels as everything else. Source: post-slice-7 review. |

### Observability expansion

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| PostHog server-side events for metrics | P1 | S | Observability | Instrument task-lifecycle events. Dashboards follow. Source: Chunk 5 decisions, tradeoffs. |
| **PostHog feature-flag wiring (kill-switches)** | **P1** | **S** | **Observability + Infra** | Slice-9 ask: kill-switch flags for ingestion + research-task spawning so we can shut off either pipeline without redeploying. Needs: (1) PostHog account + project + API key; (2) `posthog-node` SDK in `@audri/server` + `@audri/worker`; (3) two flag checks at ingestion entry + agent-task dispatch entry; (4) optional `posthog-react-native` for client-side rollout flags later. Carried from slice 9; deferred at close-out 2026-04-28 pending account setup. Drop me the project key when you create it and I'll wire the SDK. |

### Storage

### Environments

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Split dev / prod Supabase projects | P1 | S | Infra | MVP runs against a single Supabase project. Before opening up to non-Max users, split into dedicated dev + prod projects so schema iteration, seeded test data, and RLS experiments can't touch real user data. Includes: separate Supabase URLs/keys per env, Render env-var wiring, Drizzle migration runner pointed at the right project per env. Decided 2026-04-26 to defer. |
| **Render staging environment** | **P1** | **S** | **Infra** | Duplicate the existing `audri-server` + `audri-worker` services in Render with a `-staging` suffix. Point their `DATABASE_URL` at the staging Supabase project (depends on the dev/prod split above). All other env vars need to be filled in on the staging services (Gemini keys, Sentry DSNs, webhook secrets, etc.). Goal: migration runs + new-feature smoke tests don't hit prod. Listed in slice 9 build-plan; deferred at slice-9 close-out 2026-04-28. |
| **EAS Build configuration + TestFlight pipeline** | **P0 (blocked on Apple Developer enrollment)** | **M** | **Infra** | Once Apple Dev enrollment is approved: (1) create `apps/mobile/eas.json` with build profiles (development / preview / production); (2) configure Apple credentials via `eas credentials`; (3) run `eas build --platform ios --profile preview` for first TestFlight build; (4) set up `eas submit` for app-store delivery. Listed in slice 9 build-plan. Currently blocked on Apple support per memory `project_apple_dev_blocking_scope.md`. |
| **Mobile Sentry source-map upload via EAS** | **P1 (gated on EAS)** | **S** | **Infra** | When EAS Build lands (above), set three EAS secrets so the `@sentry/react-native` Expo plugin can auto-upload source maps during prod builds: `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` (org-level token with `project:releases` + `project:read` + `org:read` scopes), `SENTRY_ORG`, `SENTRY_PROJECT=audri-mobile`. Until then production stack traces show minified line/col only — Sentry capture works, but frames are unreadable. Local dev builds resolve via Metro and don't need any of this. Slice-9 close-out 2026-04-28. |

## Data model

### First-class entity sidecars (architectural pattern)

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Sidecar tables for first-class wiki entities** | **P0 (architectural direction)** | **L per entity** | **Data model + Infra** | **Pattern:** wiki page types that have a dedicated plugin surface UX get a 1:1 sidecar table joined on `page_id` to `wiki_pages`. Wiki page holds the universal stuff (title, agent_abstract, sections/body, parent hierarchy, links, tags). Sidecar holds typed domain columns for queries + indices. Ingestion writes both transactionally. Cross-references and search continue to flow through `wiki_pages`, so nothing is lost. **Governance rule:** only entities with their own plugin surface get sidecars — Wiki itself stays pure substrate; concepts/people/places/sources/notes stay pure wiki rows; sidecars are reserved for entities the user interacts with via a dedicated overlay (Todos, Projects, eventually Events). The "first-class" test = "does this have its own tile + overlay?" **Tradeoff:** schema duplication (two writes per entity, two reads per detail view); manageable at our scale, painful if discipline slips. Don't preempt — add a sidecar when the first feature genuinely needs a typed column. **Initial sidecars to land:** `todos` (Slice 8: due_date, priority, recurrence_rule, completed_at, ...) and `projects` (when project plugin lands: status enum, started_at, target_completion_at, milestones table or jsonb, ...). Source: post-slice-7 architectural conversation. |

### Artifact tables (V1)

## UX / UI

### Core surfaces

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Wiki browse UI | P0 | L | UX | Virtual folders by `type`, hierarchy tree within each, search, filter by tag/type. Source: §19. |
| CRUD UI | P0 | L | UX | Create, tombstone, edit, merge (entity disambiguation), bulk ops, undo stack, "New Project" + "Move under…" affordances. Source: §19. |
| WYSIWYG editor choice + replacement of plain-markdown editor | P0 | M | UX | **Current state (post-MVP):** `WikiSectionEditor` is a bare RN `TextInput` with monospace fallback that holds raw markdown. Functional but unfriendly — users have to know markdown syntax, and the editor doesn't render bold/italic/lists/links inline as they type. **V1 target:** WYSIWYG section editor with the basic familiar affordances (bold, italic, lists, links, inline code, headings). Doesn't need to be feature-rich — just feel native + familiar. Candidates: Lexical (Meta's, RN-friendly), TipTap (ProseMirror-based, strong web-RN parity story), or a smaller RN-native editor library (`react-native-pell-rich-editor` is the lightest option, less polish). Storage layer stays markdown — only the input affordance changes. Source: §19 + post-slice-9 review. |
| Todos UI module | P0 | M | UX | Task-management UX over `wiki_pages WHERE type='todo'` + joined `agent_tasks`. Status tabs, check-off, due dates, sub-tasks, assign-to-agent. Source: §4, §15c. |
| Todos: sub-tasks via hierarchy (rendering) | P2 | S | UX | Schema already supports nested todos (`parent_page_id` on a todo can point at another todo, not just a bucket). UI doesn't render hierarchy yet — todos appear flat under their bucket. Add indent-rendering when a todo's parent is another todo. Low urgency: agent-spawned todos always land directly under a bucket; this only matters for manual-create nesting. Source: post-slice-8 punt. |
| Todos: surface failed agent_task state on a row | P1 | S | UX | `useActiveAgentTasks` filters to `pending|running` only — failed research tasks become invisible. Extend the hook (or add a `useFailedAgentTasks`) and render a red error indicator + "tap to retry" affordance on the corresponding todo row. Wires into the existing `POST /calls/:id/retry-ingest` and a new `POST /tasks/:id/retry` (latter doesn't exist yet — small endpoint to add). Source: post-slice-8 punt. |
| Failed-ingestion retry button (UI) | P1 | S | UX | Server endpoint already exists (`POST /calls/:id/retry-ingest`). Needs a UI trigger. Originally scoped to land on a call-history surface in slice 8; that surface didn't make it. Lands wherever the activity-stream UI does (V1+). Source: slice 6.5 punt → slice 8 punt. |
| Greeting subtext: live activity reflection | P3 | S | UX | Today the home greeting shows agent + plugin counts ("1 agent · 2 plugins"). Could show live activity ("1 research running · 5 todos pending") for a more dynamic surface. Pure polish. Source: post-slice-8 punt. |
| **Projects UI module + seed root page** | P1 | M | Feature + UX + Data model | Top-level "Projects" UI surface alongside Profile, Wiki, and Todos — dedicated space for stuff the user is working on. Projection over `wiki_pages WHERE type='project'` with hierarchy expansion (each project's sub-pages: tasks, notes, sources, etc. visible under it). Includes seed `projects` root page (V1 migration adds the row alongside existing `profile` + `todos` roots). New projects default to that parent; user can reparent freely. Lifecycle TBD — likely just `active` vs. `archived` (buckets, frontmatter flag, or simple tombstone-archive — design at spec time). Pairs with project pinning (P1 above) for preload prioritization. Same projection-module pattern as Wiki + Todos (no plugin registry, client-side query logic). Source: user request 2026-04-26. |
| Graph view | P2 | L | UX | Visualization library, default filters, interactions. Source: §19. |

### Activity + notifications surfaces

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Activity-stream UI | P1 | M | UX | Mixed-type feed with grouping + snooze. Source: §19. |
| Notifications UI | P1 | M | UX | In-app screen + push payload shape (once push lands). Source: §19. |
| Call-history UI | P1 | M | UX | Listing, filtering, linking back to spawned artifacts. Source: §19. |
| Pending-artifact placeholders in plugin overlays | P0 | M | UX + Infra | All artifact UIs (Research today; Podcast / Email-draft / Brief in V1+) should show in-flight artifacts as pending entries — not invisible-until-complete. User taps the Research tile mid-generation and sees "Researching: Italian restaurants in lower Manhattan… (~2 min)" with a spinner; row hydrates to the full output when ready. Big confidence win — proves the system is working without requiring users to wait blind. Generic pattern: any plugin overlay reads BOTH the artifact collection AND a "pending tasks" view (agent_tasks where status in ('pending','running') AND kind matches), unions them with kind-specific placeholder rendering. Requires syncing agent_tasks to mobile (currently server-only — would need RLS + realtime publication migration like research_outputs got). Source: post-slice-7 UX feedback. |
| **Notification badges on home plugin tiles** | **P1** | **S** | **UX** | Per-tile "red dot" indicator (optionally with a count) showing new/unread activity for that plugin since last viewed. Sample triggers: Research = newly-completed research outputs you haven't opened; Todos = new agent-spawned todos in any non-archived bucket; Wiki = pages updated by ingestion since last visit. Implementation needs a per-tile "last viewed" timestamp (AsyncStorage initially; cloud-synced later) + reactive comparison against the live RxDB collections. Cleared when the user opens the overlay. Source: post-slice-8 UX request. |

### Contextual affordances

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Phone FAB ubiquity | P0 | S | UX | Available from every screen. Source: §19. |
| Contextual-call initialization | P1 | M | UX | Pass current-page context into call start. Source: §19. |
| Contextual source creation | P1 | M | UX | Upload source directly from a wiki page; spawn research/podcast from a source; drill from transcript to touched pages. Source: §5. |
| Project pinning | P1 | S | UX + Data model | User explicitly pins `project` pages as "active"; feeds preload prioritization. Boolean column on `wiki_pages` (or dedicated pins table). MVP uses activity-derived hot-set; V1 layers explicit pinning over it for stable user control. Source: §8 Chunk 3, §19. |
| User-pinned wiki pages (general) | P1 | S | UX + Data model | Beyond projects, let users pin any wiki page they want preloaded reliably (a person they're tracking closely, a concept they're studying). Same boolean-column or pins-table mechanism as project pinning. Source: §8 Chunk 3. |
| Plugin launcher UI | P2 | S | UX | Prototyped but confirm MVP role. Source: §19. |

### Persona + agent UX

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Agent persona-editing UX | P1 | M | UX | Rename, voice picker, `user_prompt_notes` editor. Source: §15b. |
| Agent-level config levers | P1 | L | UX + Infra | Per-agent overrides for prompt-influenced behavior — currently shipped as MVP defaults baked into the seed persona + scaffolding. Levers to expose: **writing voice** (3rd-person vs action-oriented; default action-oriented at MVP), **verbosity** (terse → verbose; default lightly terse with carve-out for explanatory contexts), **tone** (neutral → expressive; default mid-neutral, less "AI assistant cheery"), **voice** (Gemini voice id; column already exists, no UI), **persona prompt overrides** (`user_prompt_notes` already on schema). Stored on `agents` row; injected into composeSystemPrompt at call-start. Source: slice 6 prompt-tuning iterations. |
| **In-call agent-config adjustment** | **P1** | **M** | **Feature + UX** | Live tool the agent can invoke mid-call to tune its own attributes when the user asks ("be more concise", "drop the pep", "go deeper on this"). Onboarding's capability-advertisement set should include a mention so users know the lever exists. **Open architectural decision (resolve at design time):** (a) **Soft path** — store the user's stated preference in agent-scope notes (`assistant/preferences-noted`), surface them via preload, and let the prompt influence behavior; lighter, but preferences are non-deterministic and slow to propagate. (b) **Hard path** — typed columns on the `agents` row (`tone_level`, `verbosity_level`, etc.), tool sets the column, every subsequent call reads it as a hard constraint; deterministic, but requires schema + UI surface to expose+inspect. Likely answer is **both**: hard columns for the small canonical set already in "Agent-level config levers" above; soft notes for everything beyond (idiosyncratic preferences, "remember to call me by my nickname", etc.). Pairs with the **Live-Agent abort tool** and **ICS** entries in Call mode expansion. Source: post-slice-9 review. |

### Plugin-as-app navigation (architectural)

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ **Plugin overlays = apps with own router + stack navigation** (landed 2026-04-28) | **P0 (architectural)** | **L** | **UX + Infra** | Each plugin overlay (Wiki, Research) now mounts its own `<NavigationContainer>` + `<NativeStackNavigator>` inside the scale-from-tile PluginOverlay shell. Real push/pop semantics, native slide-in/out animations, back gesture. Helpers in `components/PluginStack.tsx` (`createPluginStack<T>()`, `PluginNavigationContainer`, `PluginBackRow`, `pluginStackScreenOptions`); per-plugin screens in `components/wiki/WikiNavigation.tsx` + `components/research/ResearchNavigation.tsx`. Slice 8 (Todos + Profile) builds on this. Source: post-research-validation review (2026-04-28). |

### Mobile-app polish (spawned from `specs/mobile-app.md`)

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Theme switcher + light-mode toggle | P1 | M | UX | All five Liquid Glass variants (Azure / Aurora / Ember / Verdigris / Void) tokened from MVP; V1 ships the picker UI + light-mode variants. Source: `specs/mobile-app.md` Themes. |
| Avatar tap → account / settings menu | P1 | S | UX | Top-right home avatar is a stub at MVP; V1 surfaces the account / settings menu. Source: `specs/mobile-app.md`. |
| Mic-mute UI on call screen | P2 | S | UX | Distinct visual state for muted mic mid-call. Source: `specs/mobile-app.md` Call screen. |
| In-call transcript feed | P2 | M | UX | Live transcript visible mid-call, behind a setting. Most users won't want it (reading-while-talking is anti-pattern). Source: `specs/mobile-app.md` Call screen. |
| Per-screen status-bar hiding | P3 | S | UX | Full-immersion mode for call screen. Source: `specs/mobile-app.md`. |
| **Gesture priority: plugin-dismiss vs system home-indicator** | **P1** | **S** | **UX** | When a plugin overlay is open (Wiki, Research, Profile, Todos), the iOS home-indicator swipe-up should **dismiss the overlay first**, not background the entire app. Only when the home screen itself is foregrounded (no overlay open, not in a call) should the system swipe-up gesture work normally. Implementation: `UIScreenEdgesDeferringSystemGestures` (iOS) — RN exposes via `useScreenEdgesDeferringSystemGestures` from `react-native-screens` or via Expo config. Enable on screens where we want swipe-up to be ours; disable on the home screen. Pairs naturally with the plugin-as-app navigation refactor — the deferring-gesture flag lives on the overlay shell. Android-side: `onBackPressed` already handles the back gesture, but pull-down-to-close is iOS-only so this is mostly an iOS concern. Source: post-slice-9 UX review. |
| Add-plugin tile / plugin marketplace surface | P3 | XL | UX + Feature | Discoverable surface to enable + install plugins. Tied to runtime plugin installation (already P3). Source: `specs/mobile-app.md`. |

## Security + Compliance

| Name | Priority | Effort | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Guardrails — defense-in-depth gating | P0 | XL | Security | All MVP design effort to date has been about what Audri *can* do. Companion track: defining what users **must not** be able to do. Multi-layer enforcement (model-side prompt restrictions + server-side validation + plugin-level allow/deny). No detail yet — track as a known gap to scope before public launch. Source: post-slice-6 retrospective. |

| Auth methods decision | P0 | S | Security | Email+password, Apple, Google — confirm which. Source: §20. |
| Add Apple sign-in (deferred from slice 1) | P0 | S | Security | Apple sign-in deferred during slice 1 because Apple Developer Program enrollment is blocked on Apple support (as of 2026-04-26). Re-incorporate before TestFlight push (slice 9). `expo-apple-authentication` + Supabase Auth Apple provider; entitlement requires paid enrollment. Source: build-plan slice 1, judgement-calls. |
| Replace web-auth-session OAuth with native Google Sign-In SDK | P1 | M | UX + Security | Current OAuth uses iOS `ASWebAuthenticationSession` which forces an iOS system dialog ("Audri wants to use pkeroxdh...supabase.co to Sign In") — confusing first-impression because users see Supabase's domain. Native Google Sign-In SDK (`@react-native-google-signin/google-signin` or `expo-auth-session/providers/google`) skips that dialog by using Google's native sign-in bottom-sheet + idToken exchange via `supabase.auth.signInWithIdToken`. Requires iOS OAuth Client ID in GCP (separate from current web Client ID) and paid Apple Developer enrollment for the entitlement. Cheaper interim: Supabase Pro custom auth domain ($25/mo) makes the dialog say "Audri wants to use auth.talktoaudri.com" — same flow, friendlier copy. Source: slice 1 OAuth UX feedback 2026-04-27. |

## Cost / Business

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Subscription tiers + pricing model | P0 | L | Cost-Business | Tiered subscription with gated usage vs. PAYG vs. hybrid. Source: §17b. |
| Usage events table | P0 | M | Data model + Cost | Full schema per §17b. Needed early even if pricing isn't decided — data accumulates for later analysis. |
| Rollup / summarization strategy | P1 | S | Cost-Business | Nightly `usage_daily` rollup for dashboard queries. Source: §17b. |

| Per-agent cost attribution | P2 | S | Cost-Business | `agent_id` on usage_events already carries this; surface V1+. Source: §15b. |
| Gemini explicit caching for ingestion scaffolding | P1 | M | Cost-Business + Infra | Cache the Flash candidate retrieval, Pro fan-out, agent-scope, and onboarding scaffolding prompts via Gemini's explicit caching API. Recurring Graphile job refreshes TTL. Per-prompt-version cache namespace. Estimated savings ~75% on input-token cost for ingestion (largest cost line). Worth doing once daily call volume crosses ~50/day OR monthly Gemini bill crosses ~$50. Deferred from slice 4 (2026-04-27) — at MVP volume the savings is cents per day vs. ~1-2 hours of infra to wire correctly. |
| **Waitlist + invite-driven user onboarding** | **P0 (V1 entry-gate)** | **L** | **Cost-Business + Feature** | **MVP gates users via TestFlight email allowlist** — no waitlist needed. **V1 introduces a waitlist** to control runaway cost while building toward cash-flow positive (or independent funding). Components: (a) public waitlist signup form (email-only, low friction); (b) `waitlist` table (`email`, `signed_up_at`, `invited_at`, `activated_at`, `referrer`, `notes`); (c) admin promote-from-waitlist flow → triggers invite email + supabase auth pre-registration; (d) per-cohort throttling so we don't onboard faster than budget allows. Pairs with the admin-interface entry below (where promotion happens) and the email-service entry (delivery infrastructure). Pricing-model decision (`Subscription tiers + pricing model` above) is upstream — waitlist gates against pricing tiers when those land. Source: post-slice-9 review. |

| Architecture.md sync | P0 | L | Tech debt | Make it the authoritative reference once production build begins. Currently substantially stale (see drift catalog). Source: §23 step 17. |
| Features.md sync | P0 | M | Tech debt | Lighter drift than architecture.md but missing custom agents, text mode, connectors/plugins as first-class. Source: §23 step 17. |
| Kind-registry = DB-backed | P3 | M | Tech debt | Revisit when runtime plugin installation becomes a real requirement. |
| UI module registry | P3 | M | Tech debt | Revisit when a 3rd projection module emerges (People view, Timeline view, saved-view mechanism). |
| `input_snapshot` on `agent_tasks` | P3 | S | Tech debt | Revisit if stale-context issues on mid-flight edits become user-visible. |
| Ghost recovery: don't count as attempt | P3 | S | Tech debt | Revisit if infra failures become common enough that conflating with handler failures is unfair. |
| Failed-task dedicated `todos/failed` bucket | P3 | S | Tech debt | Revisit if failure clutter hurts the pending-todo view. |
| Checkpointing for handler retries | P2 | L | Tech debt | Revisit if LLM retry cost on failures becomes material. |
| Restated-facts silent skip | P3 | S | Tech debt | Revisit if eval transcripts reveal Pro dropping actual signal framed as "already in wiki." |
| Flat index dump for Flash candidate retrieval | P2 | L | Tech debt | Refactor to retrieval-pre-filtered subset when wiki size breaks the full-dump. |
| Slug-only touched payload | P3 | S | Tech debt | Revisit if eval debugging needs per-flag rationale; add optional `reason` field for eval runs. |
| Artifact tombstone cascade for cited wiki sections | P3 | S | Tech debt | Wiki sections keep snippet + null the `ancestor_id`. Revisit if this causes UI weirdness. |
| Abstract regeneration on cosmetic-only edits | P2 | S | Tech debt | Decide whether pure reorders/metadata edits trigger abstract regen. Cost-driven. Source: §4. |
| Per-entity polymorphic artifact table | P3 | M | Tech debt | Reconsider if per-kind junction tables proliferate and share ~80% schema. Unlikely. Source: tradeoffs. |
| Canonical conditional context / prompt-forking system | P2 | L | Tech debt | Today's `composeSystemPrompt` branches by `call_type` ('generic' \| 'onboarding') with hand-written scaffolding per branch. As more conditional contexts arrive (research-task spawn, todo-spawn, mid-call agent switch, onboarding-resumption, plugin-context overlays), the branching will outgrow the if/else shape. Revisit when there are ~3+ conditional contexts in production and the pain becomes concrete — likely a registry-style prompt-layer composer. Source: post-slice-6 retrospective. |

## How to use this doc

- When a decision lands "defer to V1+" in `todos.md` or `tradeoffs.md`, add an entry here with source reference.
- Before each new planning cycle (V1 kickoff, V2 kickoff), sort by priority to pick what lands in the cycle.
- Each entry should link back to the originating decision in `todos.md` / `tradeoffs.md` / a spec via "Source: …".
- Re-priority as understanding changes. An entry may move from P2 to P0 if a user behavior pattern makes it urgent, or from P1 to P3 if it turns out not to matter.
- Not a commitment — items may be dropped entirely when they turn out not to deliver. Move those to a "Rejected" section with a note on why.
